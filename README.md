**Howdy**

I'm a diligent and dynamic UI Designer with over 3 years of total experience within the Graphic Design industry, and a significant amount of experience in working within an agile and collaborative startup environment.

I am also a highly organised, resourceful, and punctual individual who can work effectively in a team setting, as well as being keen to take on new and exciting challenges within my career.

On top of that, I'm a self-taught front end web developer that specialises in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Additionally, I enjoy creative coding and anything else that exists at the intersection of art and technology, so in my spare time, I curate and maintain the Digital Art Database, which gets all of those things into one place.

My technical skills are as follows:

+ Software Design
+ Design Thinking

+ Usability Testing
+ UI/UX Design
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Javascript
+ Processing
+ A-Frame VR
